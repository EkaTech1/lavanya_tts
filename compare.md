Long-running services


Based on your project structure and requirements, here's a detailed strategy to maintain your current setup for production while using Colab for development and experimentation:

1. **Project Organization for Hybrid Development**:

```
lavanya_tts/
├── production/               # Your current production setup
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── Fastspeech2_HS/
│   ├── static/
│   └── templates/
│
├── development/             # Development and experimentation
│   ├── notebooks/          # Colab notebooks
│   │   ├── model_training.ipynb
│   │   ├── voice_tuning.ipynb
│   │   └── experiments.ipynb
│   └── results/            # Experimental results
│
└── shared/                 # Shared resources
    ├── models/            # Model checkpoints
    ├── configs/           # Configuration files
    └── test_data/        # Test datasets
```

2. **Development Workflow**:

A. **Production Environment (Current Setup)**:
```bash
# Production running
conda activate tts_env
python app.py
```

B. **Development in Colab**:
```python
# Colab setup script
!git clone https://github.com/your-repo/lavanya_tts.git
!pip install -r lavanya_tts/requirements.txt

# Mount Google Drive for persistent storage
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

3. **Tasks Distribution**:

**Production Setup (Your Current System)**:
- ✅ Running the web service
- ✅ Handling user requests
- ✅ Real-time inference
- ✅ Audio file generation and serving

**Colab Usage**:
- ✅ Model training and fine-tuning
- ✅ Voice quality experiments
- ✅ Performance optimization tests
- ✅ New language additions testing

4. **Implementation Steps**:

A. **Set Up Version Control**:
```bash
# Create development branch
git checkout -b development

# Create specific feature branches
git checkout -b feature/new_language_support
git checkout -b experiment/voice_quality
```

B. **Create Colab Notebooks**:

1. **Model Training Notebook**:
```python
# model_training.ipynb
!git clone https://github.com/your-repo/lavanya_tts.git
!cd lavanya_tts && git checkout development

# Import your TTS modules
from Fastspeech2_HS import inference
# Your training code here
```

2. **Experimentation Notebook**:
```python
# experiments.ipynb
# For testing new features or optimizations
!git clone https://github.com/your-repo/lavanya_tts.git
!cd lavanya_tts && git checkout experiment/voice_quality

# Your experimental code here
```

5. **Data and Model Management**:

A. **Using Git LFS for Model Files**:
```bash
# In your local setup
git lfs track "*.pth"
git lfs track "*.pt"
git add .gitattributes
```

B. **Colab-Drive Integration**:
```python
# In Colab notebook
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Save experimental results
!cp /content/lavanya_tts/experiments/results/* '/content/drive/My Drive/TTS_Experiments/'
```

6. **Best Practices**:

A. **For Production**:
- Keep the main branch stable
- Regular backups of model files
- Maintain proper logging
- Monitor system resources

B. **For Development (Colab)**:
- Use separate notebooks for different experiments
- Save intermediate results to Google Drive
- Document all experiments
- Regular commits to development branches

7. **Workflow Example**:

```python
# In Colab: Testing new language support
# 1. Clone repository and setup
!git clone https://github.com/your-repo/lavanya_tts.git
!cd lavanya_tts && git checkout feature/new_language_support

# 2. Run experiments
# Test new language model
from Fastspeech2_HS import inference
# Your experimental code

# 3. Save results
!cp results/* '/content/drive/My Drive/TTS_Experiments/'

# 4. If successful, commit changes
!git add .
!git commit -m "Add support for new language"
!git push origin feature/new_language_support
```

8. **Synchronization Strategy**:

1. Development in Colab:
   - Experiment and develop new features
   - Save successful results
   - Push to development branch

2. Testing in Production:
   - Pull changes from development
   - Test in production environment
   - Deploy if successful

This hybrid approach allows you to:
- Maintain stable production service
- Experiment with new features safely
- Use Colab's resources for intensive tasks
- Keep development and production separate
- Easily roll back changes if needed

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or provide more specific examples for your use case?
